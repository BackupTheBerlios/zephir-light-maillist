Message-ID: <428D104D.9070300@free.Fr>

Hi guys,

Just to know if you have taken a first contact and talked about the 
light client?

If yes do you have any idea of what you will do?

Antoine said me long time ago, that he wanted to have a hierarchical 
organisation for you.
That is to say Batmat Light client chief, and Toutoune euhhh development 
chief ;)

I am not sure that it is useful for 2 people, however why not :D, it's 
up to you!

Just let me know...

Bye
Bryce
